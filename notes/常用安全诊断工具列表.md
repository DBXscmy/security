# 常用安全诊断工具列表

## Fireeyes 系列

### Redline
FireEye的首要免费端点安全工具Redline®为用户提供了主机调查功能，可通过内存和文件分析以及制定威胁评估配置文件来查找恶意活动的迹象。它从内存，文件系统元数据，注册表数据，事件日志，网络信息，服务，任务和Web历史记录中彻底审核并收集所有正在运行的进程和驱动程序。
### Memoryze™
Mandiant的 Memoryze™ 是免费的内存取证软件，可帮助事件响应者在实时内存中发现邪恶。Memoryze可以获取和/或分析内存映像，并且在实时系统上可以将分页文件包含在其分析中。

映像整个系统内存（不依赖API调用）。
将进程的整个地址空间映像到磁盘，包括进程的已加载DLL，EXE，堆和堆栈。
将指定的驱动程序或内存中加载的所有驱动程序映像到磁盘。
枚举所有正在运行的进程（包括被rootkit隐藏的进程）

### FakeNet
FakeNet-NG is a next generation dynamic network analysis tool for malware analysts and penetration testers.

### PdbXtract
Explore symbolic type
PdbXtract™ enables you to explore symbolic type information as extracted from Microsoft programming database files. This tool is primarily for reverse engineering of Windows-based applications and for exploring the internals of Windows kernel components.

### FLOSS
The FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS) is an open source tool that automatically detects, extracts, and decodes obfuscated strings in Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Malware analysts, forensic investigators, and incident responders can use FLOSS to quickly extract sensitive strings to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Malware authors encode strings in their programs to hide malicious capabilities and impede reverse engineering. Even simple encoding schemes defeat the ‘Strings’ tool and complicate static and dynamic analysis. FLOSS uses advanced static analysis techniques, such as emulation, to deobfuscate encoded strings.

### Highlighter
Log and text file views
Highlighter™ is a free utility designed primarily for security analysts and system administrators.

### Heap Inspector
Heap Inspector™ is a heap visualization and analysis tool that collects a process’ heaps using both API and raw methods.

### ApateDNS
ApateDNS™ is a tool for controlling DNS responses though an easy-to-use GUI.


### IOC EDITOR
The FireEye Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Editor is a free tool that provides an interface for managing data and manipulating the logical structures of IOCs. IOCs are XML documents that help incident responders capture diverse information about threats, including attributes of malicious files, characteristics of registry changes and artifacts in memory. The IOC Editor includes:

Manipulation of the logical structures that define the IOC
Application of meta-information to IOCs, including detailed descriptions or arbitrary labels
Conversion of IOCs into XPath filters
Management of lists of “terms” used within IOCs
